# 0x04. Files manager

## Overview

Welcome to the **Files Manager** project! This project is the culmination of everything you've learned in your back-end trimester, including authentication, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing. The goal is to build a simple yet functional platform where users can upload and view files, with additional features like user authentication, file permissions, and image thumbnail generation.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure your platform by authenticating users via tokens.
- **File Management**:
  - **List Files**: View all uploaded files in an organized list.
  - **Upload Files**: Easily upload new files to the platform.
  - **Permission Management**: Change the access permissions for files.
  - **File Viewing**: View files directly through the platform.
  - **Image Thumbnails**: Automatically generate thumbnails for uploaded images.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Create a robust API using **Express**.
- Implement secure user authentication.
- Store and manage data using **MongoDB**.
- Handle temporary data storage with **Redis**.
- Set up and use background workers for processing tasks like thumbnail generation.

### Project Structure

This project is structured to give you a mix of guidance and freedom. While you'll be guided step by step to build the core features, you have the flexibility to split the implementation into multiple files, use utility functions, and organize your code in a way that makes sense to you. The `utils` folder will be your ally for reusable functions and code organization.

### Why Build This?

While similar services exist in the real world, the primary aim of this project is educational. Itâ€™s designed to help you understand how to assemble various back-end technologies into a fully functioning product. By the end of this project, you'll have hands-on experience with a broad range of back-end technologies and a deeper understanding of how they fit together in a real-world application.
